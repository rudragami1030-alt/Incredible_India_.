        <p style="text-align: left;"><em>In <b>Sanatan Dharma,</b> calling the Himalayas “dark” does not mean evil or negative. The Himalayas symbolize immense power, deep penance, destruction, and profound mystery. This darkness does not represent ignorance, but truths beyond ordinary human understanding.</em></p>
        <br><br>

        <p style="text-align: right;"><em>The Himalayas are believed to be the abode of Lord Shiva. Shiva is the deity of destruction, death, and transformation. However, destruction here does not mean ruin; it means the end of ego and ignorance. Shiva is associated with cremation grounds, renunciation, and solitude, which is why his presence feels intense or “dark” to many people. His meditation away from society represents fearlessness and ultimate truth.</em></p>

        <br><br>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><em>The Himalayas are also known as a land of severe penance. Since ancient times, many sages and yogis have performed intense spiritual practices there. Living in snow, silence, and isolation created a region filled with powerful spiritual energy. It is believed that those who are not mentally prepared may find this energy difficult to handle.</em></p>

        <br><br>        

        <p style="text-align: right;"><em>Ancient texts mention that remote Himalayan regions were inhabited by beings such as Rakshasas, Yakshas, and Aghoris. These beings are not always evil, but they exist beyond normal human rules and understanding. Their presence adds to the mystery and seriousness of the Himalayas.</em></p>

        <br><br>


        <p style="text-align: left;"><em>According to belief, the Himalayas act as a bridge between different worlds. They are seen as a connection between the mortal world, the divine realms, and higher spiritual planes. Mount Kailash in particular is considered not fully accessible to humans. Stories of time distortion and unexplained experiences are shared as matters of faith.</em></p>

        <br><br>

        <p style="text-align: right;"><em>The Himalayas are personified as King Himavan, the father of Goddess Parvati. Parvati performed intense and painful penance to unite with Lord Shiva. Her struggle reflects sacrifice, endurance, and inner strength, which mirror the nature of the Himalayas themselves.</em></p>

        <br><br>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><em>In Sanatan Dharma, “darkness” never means evil. Darkness represents the unknown, overwhelming power, and a state beyond ego. This darkness may feel dangerous to the unprepared, but for a sincere seeker, it becomes the path toward light and truth.</em></p>
